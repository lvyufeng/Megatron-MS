    way to iterate over indices of dataset elements, and a :meth:`__len__` method
    that returns the length of the returned iterators.

    # NOTE [ Lack of Default `__len__` in Python Abstract Base Classes ]
    #
    # Many times we have an abstract class representing a collection/iterable of
    # data, e.g., `torch.utils.data.Sampler`, with its subclasses optionally
    # implementing a `__len__` method. In such cases, we must make sure to not
    # provide a default implementation, because both straightforward default
    # implementations have their issues:
    #
    #   + `return NotImplemented`:
    #     Calling `len(subclass_instance)` raises:
    #       TypeError: 'NotImplementedType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
    #
    #   + `raise NotImplementedError()`:
    #     This prevents triggering some fallback behavior. E.g., the built-in
    #     `list(X)` tries to call `len(X)` first, and executes a different code
    #     path if the method is not found or `NotImplemented` is returned, while
    #     raising an `NotImplementedError` will propagate and and make the call
    #     fail where it could have use `__iter__` to complete the call.
    #
    # Thus, the only two sensible things to do are
    #
    #   + **not** provide a default `__len__`.
    #
    #   + raise a `TypeError` instead, which is what Python uses when users call
    #     a method that is not defined on an object.
